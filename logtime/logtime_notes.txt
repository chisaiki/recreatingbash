This assignment is not especially challenging algorithmically, but it requires attention to detail and it exercises
several different knowledge areas.

Goal: List out the total log time for each specified user (found in /var/log/wtmp)
    If no user is specified then do it for current user
    if -a option is present then do it for all users 
    if -f then use a specific file 

Notes: 
[Finish after?]command-line option parsing (use getopt)
give file path
need to open file
reading kernel data structure (the wtmp file)
manipulate Unix time values
print whats written inside onto display 

Error Note:
While not completely an error, if I use WSL to find /var/log/wtmp it won't be able to find it
because this is a Linux path not necessarily windows which is what my computer is running in!
