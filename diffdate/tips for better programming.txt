look at main and go down from a top down view, 

make functions more descriptive, made program larger by repeating elements, tons of replicated code 

ex. set locale in main 

make all terminal programs to be within 80 lines since thats how code wraps on terminal

memset - fill memory with a constant byte (ex. a struct)

try to avoid division and mod (unless mod power 2) is always going to be slow
