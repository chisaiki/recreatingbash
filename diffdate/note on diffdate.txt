2 seperate break statements based on the amount of inputs (1 or 2)

case '2':

find the difference between today and the date given, if input_year - current year > 0 ---> future

else past 

case '3':
seperate differe parts of the date (if year1 - year2 < 0 then year1 is earlier)
(if year1 - year2 > 0 then year1 is later than year 2)
But it looks like it wants me to do the second if in terms of year2 being ".. days before" year1

Output must be based on LC_TIME locale 

strftime - format date and time (must use this)


The C library function char *ctime(const time_t *timer) returns a string representing the localtime based on the argument timer.

The returned string has the following format: Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy, where Www is the weekday, Mmm the month in letters, dd the day of the month, hh:mm:ss the time, and yyyy the year.
